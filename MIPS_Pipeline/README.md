# Steps to evaluate:  
- Translate the contents from one of the *.asm files using the driver given on mycourses  
        OR use your own *.asm files  
- Copy the translated binary codes into program.txt  
- Run "source predict_untaken_testbench.tcl"  
- Check when the "Execution finished." string is printed.  
- Run "source 1_bit_predictor_testbench.tcl"  
- Check when the "Execution finished." string is printed.  
- Run "source 2_bit_predictor_testbench.tcl"  
- Check when the "Execution finished." string is printed.  
- Compare the tree results.
